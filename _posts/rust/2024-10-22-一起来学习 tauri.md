### 安装
#### 1. Mac [安装 rust](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#rust):
执行：
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
安装路径：
```
RUSTUP_HOME: ~/.rustup
CARGO_HOME: ~/.cargo
The cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands: ~/.cargo/bin
This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:
  ~/.profile
  ~/.bash_profile
  ~/.zshenv
```
结果：
```
Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, you need to source
the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
```
卸载：
```
rustup self uninstall
```
